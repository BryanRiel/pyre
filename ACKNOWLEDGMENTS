    None of this would have been possible without Dan Meiron, Mike Gurnis, and Brent Fultz, all
    of whom took a risk by supporting pyre at various stages in its development.

    Much of the current design of pyre is due to ideas and constructive criticism by Leif
    Strand. 

    Raul Radovitzky, Brad Aagaard and Patrick Hung taught me a lot about the needs of massively
    parallel applications.
    
    Jiao Lin has built a very sophisticated web-based application by stretching pyre beyond its
    limit and contributing countless use cases that had a significant impact on the current
    implementation.

    Mike McKerns, Tim Kelly, Brandon Keith were early adopters and made significant
    improvements to he usability of he package. Most of the existing documentation and user
    support over the past ten years has been possible thanks to their remarkable efforts.
