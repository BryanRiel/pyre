class HierarchicalModel(Model):
    """
    Storage and naming services for calc nodes

    This class assumes that the node names form a hierarchy, very much like path names. They
    are expected to be given as tuples of strings that specify the names of the "folders" at
    each level.

    HierarchicalModel provides support for links, entries that are alternate names for other
    folders.
